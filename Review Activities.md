1. **Hardware and software**: Hardware is a physical parts computer that cause processing of data. Software is a set of instruction that tells a computer exactly what to do.

2. **Motherboard**: An insulated board within an electronic device into which circuits or wires are connected and plugged

3. **Microprocessor**: A microprocessor is a computer processor that incorporates the functions of a central processing unit on a single (or more) integrated circuit

4. **BIOS**: It's BIOS that's responsible for the POST and therefore makes it the very first software to run when a computer is started

5. **RAM**: A computer memory on which data can be both read and written and on which the location of data does not affect the speed of its retrieval

6. **ROM**: ROM is the permanent part of a computer's memory

7. **Cache memeory**: Cache memory is a small-sized type of volatile computer memory that provides high-speed data access to a processor and stores frequently used computer programs, applications and data.

8. **Internal and external storage units**: Internal storage device: it is an internal component of the computer, server. Example: hard drives/ssds, internal storage controller. Internal dvd unit. The internal storage device is not a full separated system having its own operating system, the server operating system is managing this device.
External storage device: we are connecting those to the computers/servers by the help of physical ports (USB generally speaking), fiber optic, network. These devices may be full systems (having their own operating system, having the possibility to be managed, but generally, when we say external storage, we mean “small device (hard drive, ssd disk, ssd drive) that can be connected easily by USB to a PC/server”.

9. **The difference between momories and storage units (or storage devices)**: Memory is basically made of RAM chips, while storage, in general terms, refers to hard drives or solid-state drives

10. **Operating system**: It is software that communicates with the hardware and allows other programs to run

11. **Which component is the connector that joins the power supply to the motherboard?**: The industry standard ATX power-supply–to–motherboard main connector is the Molex 39-29-9202 (or equivalent) 20-pin ATX style connector

12. **LAN**: A LAN is a network of connected devices that exist within a specific location

13. **MAN**:  A metropolitan area network (MAN) is similar to a local area network (LAN) but spans an entire city or campus, or some other municipal or organizational territory.

14. **WAN**: A wide area network (WAN) is a telecommunications network that extends over a large geographic area for the primary purpose of computer networking.

15. **The difference between programs and applications**: A computer program is a set of instructions that can be executed on a computer. An application is software that directly helps a user perform tasks. The two intersect, but are not synonymous. A program with a user-interface is an application, but many programs are not applications.

16. **The path**: In a computer operating system, a path is the route through a file system to a particular file

17. **File**: A computer file is a computer resource for recording data discretely in a computer storage device

18. **Folder**: In computers, a folder is the virtual location for applications, documents, data or other sub-folders

19. **Primary partition**: Any partition that has an operating system installed to it is called a primary partition.

20. **Extended partition**: An extended partition is a primary partition that has been divided up into logical partitions as a means of creating more partitions than the four that would otherwise be possible

21. **Explain the different areas of scope of a LAN, a MAN, and a WAN. put an example of each of them**: The geographical area covered by LAN is small, whereas, MAN covers relatively large and WAN covers the greatest of all. 
LAN is confined to schools, hospitals or buildings, whereas, MAN connects small towns or Cities and on the other hand, WAN covers Country or a group of Countries.

22. **Explain what a computer network is. List some of the computer networks you use in your daily life**:  A computer network connects parts of a distributed architecture, whether those parts are made up of hardware, or virtual or logical resources.
Some examples are the network of devices connected to my Wifi Router
